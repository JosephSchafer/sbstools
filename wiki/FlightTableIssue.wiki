=Description=

Sometimes aircrafts seem to change their callsign many times during a flight. Unfortunately the Basestation software then introduces a new flightid. As the flightobserver-daemon only inserts new flights when a new aircraft appears on the Basestation screen, there are important flightdata-records not associated with an existing entry in the flights-table. 

The following sql statement presents all flightdata not connected to an existing flight:
{{{
SELECT DISTINCT flightid FROM flightdata WHERE AND '2007-04-07 00:00' AND flightid NOT IN (SELECT id FROM flights);
}}}

=First Solutionblock=

   * flightobserver.py creates new entry to table flights when the callsign is set

==Issue==
Example: Flight ELY008 changed its callsign several times and so many new flight entries were created. => summarize these flights into one and update flightdata + airbornevelocity tables!

{{{
SELECT distinct flights.id, callsign, aircrafts.hexident, flights.ts FROM flights LEFT JOIN flightdata ON flights.id=flightdata.flightid LEFT JOIN aircrafts ON flights.aircraftid=aircrafts.id WHERE ts BETWEEN '2007-04-08 00:00' AND '2007-04-09 00:00' ORDER BY hexident, flights.ts;
