=Description=

Sometimes aircrafts seem to change their callsign many times during a flight. Unfortunately the Basestation software then introduces a new flightid. As the flightobserver-daemon only inserts new flights on a new aircraft appears on the Basestation screen, there are important flightdata-records not associated with an existing entry in the flights-table. 

The following sql statement presents all flightdata not connected to an existing flight:
{{{
SELECT DISTINCT flightid FROM flightdata WHERE AND '2007-04-07 00:00' AND flightid NOT IN (SELECT id FROM flights);
}}}

=Possible Solutions=

   * Try to insert missing flights into the flights table and then a script shall set all flightdata belonging together to one single flight.

  * flightobserver.py shall hold a aircraftid<->flightid mapping and rewrite a new flightid
