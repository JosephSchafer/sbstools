#nonsense data has to be tagged

= Introduction =

Some flights send incorrect GPS-data, see: http://www.kinetic-avionics.co.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?t=3491
My first approach was to remove GPS data out of a certain range but this was not sufficient.

   # calculate distance between adjacent points (longitude, latitude) [http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/55417.html]
   # check for GPS coordinates out of range
   # tag these flights (introduce new field named _gpsaccuracy_)

The credo is: *Tag but do not remove incorrect data*
