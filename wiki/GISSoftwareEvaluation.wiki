    performance issues: 
    takes about 500 seconds to calculate if GPS-coordinate (Point) is within polygon
    takes the same time to calculate if linestring (flight line consists of ~1000 coordinates) is within polygon (map of Vorarlberg contains 79754 coordinates!)

==Solution==

We stick with Python GDAL/OGR. A simplified map was created using the Douglas-Peucker algorithm. Mapshaper:http://www.mapshaper.org does the job!
