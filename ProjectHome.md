The sbstools provide the following functionality:

  * reading data from Basestation's port 30003 and storing data in a mysql database
  * "cleaning up" data, i.e. tag flights with incorrect GPS data, solve "callsign flickering" issue
  * processing the flights geographically, i.e. check if flightline intersects with given geometry
